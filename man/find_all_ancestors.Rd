\title{Retrieve all directed ancestors of each node in a causal graph}
\usage{
find_all_ancestors(adj)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj}{A square adjacency matrix in MIIC format:
0 = no edge, 1 = undirected, 2 = i → j, -2 = j → i, 6 = i ↔ j.}
}
\value{
A named list where each entry is a character vector
containing the nodes that are directed ancestors of the corresponding variable.
}
\description{
For each node, this function performs a backward traversal along directed edges (i.e., parent relationships),
collecting all nodes that have a directed path (→) to the target node.
It is designed for MIIC-style adjacency matrices used in partially oriented graphs (e.g., PAGs),
where only directed edges (2 = i → j) are followed.
}
\details{
This function is typically used during edge orientation to identify ancestral constraints.
